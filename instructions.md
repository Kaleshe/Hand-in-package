#Styling Links
##Step-by-Step Instructions
- Go into "style.css" and add the selector"a:hover" because we want to select the anchor tag in its hover state (a:hover MUST come after a:link and a:visited)
- Style it how you want it to be styled. You can change the size, color, text-decoration. Anything you want! 
*To change the opacity, you can add "opacity: (any integer from 0 - 1);" Eg. opacity: 0.7;*
