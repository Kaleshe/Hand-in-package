#Styling Links
##Step-by-Step Instructions
1. Go into "style.css" and add the selector"a:hover". This is because we want to select the anchor tag in its "hover" state (a:hover MUST come after a:link and a:visited)

2. Style it how you want it to be styled. You can change the size, color, text-decoration. Anything you want! You may also change the properties of the other link selectors such as "a:visited", "a:link" and "a:active".
*To change the opacity, you can add "opacity: (any integer from 0 - 1);" Eg. opacity: 0.7;*
